<h1>genetic algorithm on ROS environment </h1>

An implementation of genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters of Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithm utilized as the means for sensor fusion for vehicle localization.
The sensors used are GNSS, IMU, and wheel encoders with five states in the algorithm: _x_, _y_, \x{o}, \y{o}, $\gamma$.

All this is me and [my partner](https://github.com/anzulfa)'s final project for our undergraduate thesis.
